AF_PACKET High-Performance Network Library for pASM/WAVE/Vector SDK

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This library provides high-performance AF_PACKET bindings for Rust, specifically designed for integration into the pASM/WAVE/vector SDK ecosystem. It enables raw packet capture and transmission on Linux systems using memory-mapped ring buffers for maximum efficiency.

CORE CAPABILITIES:
- Raw packet capture using Linux AF_PACKET interface
- Memory-mapped ring buffers (TPACKET_V3) for zero-copy operations
- Multi-threaded packet processing with kernel flow balancing
- High-throughput packet transmission capabilities
- Performance metrics and monitoring integration

SDK INTEGRATION PURPOSE:
This library serves as the foundational networking layer for the pASM/WAVE/vector SDK, providing:
- Low-latency packet processing for network security applications
- High-throughput data ingestion for vector processing pipelines
- Real-time network monitoring and analysis capabilities
- Efficient packet filtering and classification

TARGET PERFORMANCE:
- 120,000+ packets per second processing capability
- Sub-microsecond packet processing latency
- Multi-core scaling with linear performance improvements
- Memory-efficient operation with minimal allocations

DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS:
- Network security monitoring and analysis
- High-frequency trading network capture
- IoT device communication monitoring
- Real-time network protocol analysis
- Vector-based network anomaly detection

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Linux kernel 3.1+ with AF_PACKET support
- Root privileges for raw socket operations
- Multi-core CPU for optimal performance
- Sufficient memory for ring buffer allocation

INTEGRATION STATUS:
Currently undergoing comprehensive review and enhancement for SDK integration.
All components are being audited for security, performance, and API compatibility.
